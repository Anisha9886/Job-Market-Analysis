# Job-Market-Analysis
Hey there! 👋 I want to share a quick overview of my Job Market Analysis project. The idea behind this project was to dig into job-related data and uncover some cool insights about the current job market.

 I focused on figuring out things like:

💼 Which locations have the most job opportunities?
💰 What’s the salary range for different roles?
🏢 Which companies are hiring the most?
🛠️ What skills are in demand for top job titles?

I used Python for data cleaning and analysis, along with Power BI to create some nice visualizations. The project also involved working with real-world data, and I used pandas for handling the data and SQL for some structured queries.

The goal here was to provide insights that could help job seekers know where the opportunities are and what skills they should focus on. It’s also helpful for businesses to see which areas are more competitive in terms of hiring.

This was a fun project to work on because it gave me a better understanding of how data analysis can be applied to real-world scenarios, especially in a space as dynamic as the job market.

This is the dashboard i created in Power Bi
